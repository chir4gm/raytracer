# Raytracer in Python
## A bare-bones raytracer written in Python to learn:
- PBRT
- GPU Programming and Optimization

## Usage
```sh
python3 script.py
```
## Roadmap
Step 1: Write a complete raytracer with support for lighting and reflections + 3D Models and Skybox Images

Step 2: Optimize code and implement advanced techniques

Step 3: GOTO Step 2.
